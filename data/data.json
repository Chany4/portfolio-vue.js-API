I am a very outgoing person, who is confident in her ability to establish connections with the people she meets. My love for coding sparked at an early age, which I can roughly pinpoint to Primary School, when I watched this movie about young programmer creating innovative solutions to everyday problems. This inspiration led me to explore the fascinating world of technology and development. I am a hard working individual who is always up for a challenge no matter how tedious it may seem. I absoloutely love learning new things. This is showcased through the fact that I am currently learning three languages, aside from coding, which are Mandarin, Korean and Arabic. My Hobbies include crocheting, knitting, dancing,singing and diy crafts and I put my  hobbies to use when I started my own business",
